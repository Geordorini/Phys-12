#### Week 1: Introduction 

Here is my idea for my final project: 

![The Big Idea](./Thebigidea.jpg)



An add on to a door handle that turns it into a digital lock without replacing the lock itself.
This would use a thumbprint sensor and a code to unlock the door.


![The key](./Thekey.jpg)

Using the hole of the key in the mechanism is the way to turn the key reliably. By inserting a rod into the key that rotates when the correct pin and thumb print are entered, the door is unlocked and ready to be opened.

As shown above the rod would fit into the hole of the key and turn. The device would need the Key to be inserted into the keyhole of the lock already. After entering a code and using a thumbprint scanner the device will then turn to unlock the door. The thumbprint scanner and two step verification as a whole create a higher level of security. If someone were to break the mechanism off of the handle, they would have immediate access to the key. Hopefully no one will do that. However, this item solves the problem of getting locked out of your room. I often almost forget my key while leaving my dorm. This allows me to get back into my dorm even if I forget anything in the room.
