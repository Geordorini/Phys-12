#### Shaper Tutorial

  3. Set up
The shaper uses tape to locate it self and cut. Seting up an area with tape is nessiary to useing the machine. The tape does not stick to obs, but if you are doing a small print you can get away with no tape over where you are cuting. The machine uses two cameras. One over the spindle and one looking infornt of the machine. It uses the one looking over the machine to postion it self. Make sure to measure the depth of the material you are cutting. In the lab there is a sacrifce board right now. If there is no sacrfice board it is probaly a really good idea to put one down so you dont destroy the surface you are cutting on. Make sure to bolt down the material you are cutting. I have only cut wood so far.

3. Scan
Plug the Shaper in. Before cutting you must make a new scan of work area. It scans using the camera in front of the machine. Sometimes you might need to scan a little bit off the tabel in order to see the wood while cutting.

4. Device 
  Plug in the usb to the usb port. Then click import. Find your file then place it using the intuitave placing system. There are scalling options too. Place the design on the object on the surface you are cutting on. Then click cut. Now, rember the depth of the material enter that into the depth setings in the top left corner of the cutting page.
