#### Inputs Week 5

Part one: Piezo 
 The first input device I tinkered with was the piezo sensor. It senses vibrations. I belived that this could be a useful input device for my final project. This is the circutry I used for the piezo sensor. <br>

This is a piezo sensor.

 The piezo sensor measures vibraitons and they look like this.

 

<br>

It is really difficult to see but every so often the line goes a little extra crazy and reaches a high point. That happended because I hit the table the piezo sensor was on. That high point is 1,023. Using that knoweldge I am able to disguish a knock or vibration from no knock. Here is the code that is mainly comprisded from the website but I added in the little if statement to only print KNOCK when the table is hit.

<pre><code>
int analog_pin = A3;
int tx_pin = 4;
int read_high;
int read_low;
int diff;
int big;  

void setup() {
    pinMode(tx_pin, OUTPUT);      // Pin 4 provides the voltage step
    Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
    digitalWrite(tx_pin,HIGH);           // Step the voltage high on conductor 1.
    read_high = analogRead(analog_pin);  // Measure response of conductor 2.
    delayMicroseconds(100);              // Delay to reach steady state.
    digitalWrite(tx_pin,LOW);            // Step the voltage to zero on conductor 1.
    read_low = analogRead(analog_pin);   // Measure response of conductor 2.
    diff = read_high - read_low;         // desired answer is the difference between high and low.
  if(diff>1020){
    Serial.println("KNOCK!");
  }
  
        
}
</code></pre>

Here is a video of the KNOCK sensor working.
