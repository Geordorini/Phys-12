#### Cnc Milling
There were many options for what we could use to CNC Mill. We could use a 2d Mill, the shopbot, a 2.5d mill, or the Shaper. The shop bots key went missing so I decided to use the Shaper. For some reason the people who made shaper wants the user to make an account and uppload files to the shaper via thier webiste. This did not work for me, because I forgot about Harvard's two step verification. This did not allow the Shaper to conncect to the internet. I struggled this for a long while until I realized something. There is a usb on the side of the shaper.

This allowed me send designs to the shaper without using the internet. With this obstacle overcome, I could begin my desgin. I wanted to design a toilet seat from obs. The design was very simple. First I got the diemensions of a toilet seat from online.

Here is the <a href="https://www.plumbingsupply.com/how-to-measure-for-a-toilet-seat.html#:~:text=Typical%20width%3A%2014%22%20%2D%2014,length%3A%2018%22%20%2D%2019%22
">link to that webiste if you feel like visitng it./a>

Now that I knew the diemnsions of the seat I began designing. I wanted to create the least comfortable experencie possible. Here is the design.

I had to extrude the design even though I was cutting in 2d with the Shaper, since the Shaper plugin for fusion really wanted me to. Now that I had finished the design I exported the file as an svg to a usb.
