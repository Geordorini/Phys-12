### 3d Printing and 3d Scanning

For this weeks assignment I made a 3d printed model and scanned an item in 3d. I wanted to make a cursed object as my 3d model. I wanted to make an awful looking pacman. It all began with a sphere.

Then I needed to make pac mans mouth. I did this using a rectangle and the extrude tool.

After making the mouth, I needed to make the teeth. I did this by making a triangle and then forming a a spline. I put a point on each vector and the midpoint of legs of the triangle.

This alone would make a fine looking terrible pac man, but I could not print the unsupported teeth. I needed to figure out a way to support the teeth from within the mouth. I decide to make drool. 
I did this by combing a sphere with a cylnder and then filleting the edge between them.

In Fusion 360 this is how the final looked.

However the teeth were still not supported fully so in the G code exporter, Prusa, I gave the cursed masterpiece organic looking supports.

I then exported the G code to an SD card and inserted it into a 3d printer. Here are the final results.

### Scanning 3d objects

I also needed to an object in 3d. I grabbed the nearest rubber ducky and began scanning.

Using the revo software and camera I was able to scan an object into 3d.

Here is the intial scan in 3d. As you can see there are holes in the scan which you can fill by using Revo studio and the hole filling tool.
