#### Week 1: Introduction 

Here is my idea for my final project: 

![The Big Idea](./Thebigidea.jpg)



An add on to a door handel that turns it into a digital lock without replacing the lock itself.
This would use a thumbprint senosor and a code to unlock the door.

![The key](./Thekey.jpg)

Using the hole of the key in the mechanism, it is possible to turn the key using a rod. 

![A tinkercad of the rod in the keyhole](./Keyholerod.png)

As shown above the rod would fit into the hole of the key and turn. The device would the Key to be inserted into the keyhole of the lock already. After entering a code and using a thumbprint scanner the device will then turn to unlock the door. I want to use a two step verification procces so that the dorm is more secure. The thumb print scanner and two step verfication as a whole create a higher level of security. There are flaws in this design. If someone were to break the mechanism off of the handle, they would have imeedate accses to the key. This item solves the problem of geting locked out of your room. I often almost forget my key while leaving my dorm. This alows me to get back into my dorm even if I forget anything in the room.
