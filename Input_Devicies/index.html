#### Inputs Week 5

Part one: Piezo 
 The first input device I tinkered with was the piezo sensor. It senses vibrations. I belived that this could be a useful input device for my final project. This is the circutry I used for the piezo sensor. <br>

 The piezo sensor measures vibraitons and they look like this.

It is really difficult to see but every so often the line goes a little extra crazy and reaches a high point. That happended because I hit the table the piezo sensor was on. That high point is 1,023. Using that knoweldge I am able to disguish a knock or vibration from no knock. Here is the code that is mainly comprisded from the website but I added in the little if statement to only print KNOCK when the table is hit.
