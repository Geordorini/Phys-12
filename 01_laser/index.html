#### Week 2: Laser Cuttering and 3d Cad 






Laser cutting is a very fast form of digital fabrication that is capable of printing different materials in seconds. The laser cutter only prints in 2d but using press fit designs it is possible to make 3d objects. In order to make a press fit design work the thickness of the material has to match the width of the notch. The notch is the hole designed to fit around the material to connect different pieces.



![First Try](./Firstmeasurementr.png)

Speaking of Design, above is my first itteration of the press fit peice. I wanted to make an absrtact structure using one peice. The first design was a diamond that measured 50 by 35 milimeters. In order to make this design I first created a new file in Fusion 360. Then I created a new sketch. I chose to do my sketch from the top. I then used the reactangle tool to make a rectangle of those demensions. Then I used the line tool to connect the adjacent midpoints in the rectangle. Then, I delted the orignal lines of the rectangle and was left with the product above. 

![First Kerf](./Measurementsfirstkerfr.png)

In the first ideration of the design I made, I presumed the Kerf of the laser cutter was .8 milimeters. The kerf is the material that the laser cutter takes off from the material that goes unaccounted for in a design. This was the primary challenge of the press fit design. In order to account for the kerf, I had to subtract the thickness of the material by the estimated kerf. I disguinshed the kerf by finding the difference in the cad model and the physical model in size of notch. The Kerf turned out to be 1 milimeter.

One of the final steps of the process is using the fillet tool to curve the edges of the design. In order to use that tool effectively, I had to extrude the design into 3d then use the fillet tool on all the notchs corners.

This is what the final design ended up looking like. I nneded to shrink the size of the design in order to limit the amount of waste I produced. It did not really mater if I made a massive peice or a small one so I figured I would use a smaller one. Finally, after doing all of this designg  I put some carboard in the laser cutter.

Below is the cad file.

Here are two of the structures I built with the pressfit peices. For both structures I was able to use my prior failures of prints. I had printed shapes too large. Instead of throwing them away I used them in sculpture.

In order to make the final strucutre I had to try multiple times to get kerf right. I also had issues in printing. I messed up my scailling somewhere inbetween the cad and the printer once. 

####Tutorial Design

I chose a tutorial for a tool I did not know how to use, the sweep tool. The sweep tool sweeps a sketch profile or planar face along a selected path. First thing I did was make a recangular prism by starting a new sketch from the top making a recantgle and then extruding it. After that, I created another new sketch but this time I used the text tool to put my name on the top of the rectangle. Then I started a sketch from the side where I used a three point arc. Then using the sweep tool I swept up my name from the rectangle along the path of the arc

Below is the cad file of the Sweep tool tutorial.

### Designing on my own

I decide to design my phone and my earbuds. First I had to measure my earbuds. They were 50 milimeters by 50.2 mm by 27.8 mm. Here is a photo of my earbuds below.

Then I made a rectangle of the same demisions.

![StartofRecangularPrisimr](./StartofRecangularPrisimr.png)

Then I used a lot of the filleting tool to create the curved edges on my earbuds. Infact I used the filet tool on every corner of the design. My earbuds have this divot in them about two thirds of the way up. This was easily one of the hardeest parts to figure out. Since I completed this design before any tutorial on fusion 360. I learned how to use the split tool. I need to split out a peice of the body of the design in order to create the divot. I created a recangle that was larger than earbuds and used it as my splitting tool.

After spliting out the piece of body that needed to have a divot, I then started to make the divot.
