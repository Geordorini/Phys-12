#### Week 2: Laser Cuttering and 3d Cad 






Laser cutting is a very fast form of digital fabrication that is capable of printing different materials in seconds. The laser cutter only prints in 2d but using press fit designs it is possible to make 3d objects. In order to make a press fit design work the thickness of the material has to match the width of the notch. The notch is the hole designed to fit around the material to connect different pieces.

In the first ideration of the design I made, I presumed the Kerf of the laser cutter was .8 milimeters. The kerf is the material that the laser cutter takes off from the material that goes unaccounted for in a design.

Using the hole of the key in the mechanism is the way to turn the key reliably. By inserting a rod into the key that rotates when the correct pin and thumb print are entered, the door is unlocked and ready to be opened.

As shown above the rod would fit into the hole of the key and turn. The device would need the Key to be inserted into the keyhole of the lock already. After entering a code and using a thumbprint scanner the device will then turn to unlock the door. The thumbprint scanner and two step verification as a whole create a higher level of security. If someone were to break the mechanism off of the handle, they would have immediate access to the key. Hopefully no one will do that. However, this item solves the problem of getting locked out of your room. I often almost forget my key while leaving my dorm. This would allow me to get back into my dorm even if I forget anything in the room.
