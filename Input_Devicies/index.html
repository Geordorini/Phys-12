#### Inputs Week 5

Part one: Piezo 
 The first input device I tinkered with was the piezo sensor. It senses vibrations. I belived that this could be a useful input device for my final project. This is the circutry I used for the piezo sensor. <br>

This is a piezo sensor.

 The piezo sensor measures vibraitons and they look like this.

 

<br>

It is really difficult to see but every so often the line goes a little extra crazy and reaches a high point. That happended because I hit the table the piezo sensor was on. That high point is 1,023. Using that knoweldge I am able to disguish a knock or vibration from no knock. Here is the code that is mainly comprisded from the website but I added in the little if statement to only print KNOCK when the table is hit.

<pre><code>
int analog_pin = A3;
int tx_pin = 4;
int read_high;
int read_low;
int diff;
int big;  

void setup() {
    pinMode(tx_pin, OUTPUT);      // Pin 4 provides the voltage step
    Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
    digitalWrite(tx_pin,HIGH);           // Step the voltage high on conductor 1.
    read_high = analogRead(analog_pin);  // Measure response of conductor 2.
    delayMicroseconds(100);              // Delay to reach steady state.
    digitalWrite(tx_pin,LOW);            // Step the voltage to zero on conductor 1.
    read_low = analogRead(analog_pin);   // Measure response of conductor 2.
    diff = read_high - read_low;         // desired answer is the difference between high and low.
  if(diff>1020){                         // make only knocks register
    Serial.println("KNOCK!");            // print the knock  
  }
  
        
}
</code></pre>

Here is a video of the KNOCK sensor working.

There is not a really good way to measure the vaules of the piezo meter. I was able to make a knock or no knock.

### Part Two: Capacitive Sensor

This is much cooler than the peizo sensor. Using copper spring and some matierals to hold them up I made a Capacitive scale. 

![mid](./mid.jpg)

The sensor it self is very simple. It is a coper tape sandwitch; Oh the top is coper tape facing down and the tape rests on a peice of carboard. The cardboard is supported by five springs. The springs sit on a peice of wood to get simular measuremnets every time. The wood sits on the copper tape. The cooper tape faces each other. 


![circuit](./circutforall.jpg)<br>


The circutry is the exact same as the piezo sensor. 

The first step is to read the capctive scale with no weight. It gave many readings so I took a few of them and averaged them out. Then I started puting items on a scale and weighing them. 

![bernays](./bernays.jpg)

That is a copy of Edwards Bernays's book Propaganda and I did use it as a refernce for weight when trying to find an equation for conversion. After wweihing porpagnda I then put it on the cpactive scale and recorded it in excell. I did this wiht a few other objects and ended up with this excell spreadsheet and this graph.

The trendline in the excell file alows me to make the conversion from digital units to grams. When coding this I ran into many issues with the math of converting due to the defintion of variables. I ended up neepding to multiply then divide rather than multiply by a decimal. Here is the code. Once again this is mainly the website. 

long result;   //variable for the result of the tx_rx measurement.
int analog_pin = A3;
int tx_pin = 4;

<pre><code>

void setup() {
    pinMode(tx_pin, OUTPUT);      //Pin 4 provides the voltage step
    Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
    result = tx_rx();
    Serial.println(result);
}


long tx_rx(){         // Function to execute rx_tx algorithm and return a value
                      // that depends on coupling of two electrodes.
                      // Value returned is a long integer.
  int read_high;
  int read_low;
  int diff;
  long int sum;
  int N_samples = 100;    // Number of samples to take.  Larger number slows it down, but reduces scatter.
  long int Mult; //x in = of trendline
  int adder; // b in = of trendline
  int divder;
  sum = 0;
  Mult = 51;
  divder = 1250;
  adder = -498.58;

  for (int i = 0; i < N_samples; i++){
   digitalWrite(tx_pin,HIGH);              // Step the voltage high on conductor 1.
   read_high = analogRead(analog_pin);     // Measure response of conductor 2.
   delayMicroseconds(100);                 // Delay to reach steady state.
   digitalWrite(tx_pin,LOW);               // Step the voltage to zero on conductor 1.
   read_low = analogRead(analog_pin);      // Measure response of conductor 2.
   diff = read_high - read_low;            // desired answer is the difference between high and low.
   sum += diff;// Sums up N_samples of these measurements.
    sum = (sum * Mult); // use a fraction rather than a decimal to dodge the float issues this is the numerator 
    sum = (sum / divder); // this the denominator 
    sum +=  adder // add the b of y = mx + b 
    
  
    
          //convert the digital to grams using excell trendline                    
 }
  return sum;
}

I likely could have used simpler code and achived a better result.
