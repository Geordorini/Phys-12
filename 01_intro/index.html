#### Week 1: Introduction (Final Project Idea) 

Here is my idea for my final project: 

![The Big Idea](./Thebigidea.jpg)



An add on to a door handle that turns it into a digital lock without replacing the lock itself.
This would use a thumbprint sensor and a code to unlock the door.


![The key](./Thekey.jpg)

Using the hole of the key in the mechanism is the way to turn the key reliably. By inserting a rod into the key that rotates when the correct pin and thumb print are entered, the door is unlocked and ready to be opened.  
![A tinkercad of the rod in the keyhole](./Keyholerodsmall.png)

As shown above the rod would fit into the hole of the key and turn. The device would need the Key to be inserted into the keyhole of the lock already. After entering a code and using a thumbprint scanner the device will then turn to unlock the door. The thumbprint scanner and two step verification as a whole create a higher level of security. If someone were to break the mechanism off of the handle, they would have immediate access to the key. Hopefully no one will do that. However, this item solves the problem of getting locked out of your room. I often almost forget my key while leaving my dorm. This would allow me to get back into my dorm even if I forget anything in the room. 


### Honestly thats all kinda lame. How can it be cooler?
Doors are entrways or some might say portals into another room. I want to combine my love of Latin with doors. I want to create door that is unlocked by knocking rythmicly to the poetic latin inscribed on the door.

The input of the device is the rythm of the knocking.

I need to figure an input device that can disguinsih long from short knocks. Im not sure if a vibration sensor would be capable of reading difference between long and short knocks. There are three sets of legs in Latin poetry, dactyl spondee and trochee. The dactyl is long short short. The Spondee is long long. The trochee is only used at the end of hexameter and is Long short. The last twoo feet of hexameter is either a Spondee or Trochee. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pc2ehkSEAI&t=12s This video shows a vibration senor that might work. Since latin poetry is classified into these rules, Im must figure out a way to turn sets of knocks into Dactyls Spondees and Trochees.

The piezo sensor doesnt not allow me to measure short and long knocks, However, using a capcitive senor short and long knocks can be measured. I need to build a model door.
