#### Cnc Milling

There were many options for what we could use to CNC Mill. We could use a 2d Mill, the shopbot, a 2.5d mill, or the Shaper. The shop bots key went missing so I decided to use the Shaper. For some reason the people who made the Shaper want the user to make an account and upload files to the shaper via their website. This did not work for me, because I forgot about Harvard's two step verification. This did not allow the Shaper to connect to the internet. I struggled with this for a long while until I realized something. There is a usb on the side of the shaper.

This allowed me to send designs to the shaper without using the internet. With this obstacle overcome, I could begin my design. I wanted to design a toilet seat that is made out of obs. The design was very simple. First I got the dimensions of a toilet seat from online.

Here is the <a href="https://www.plumbingsupply.com/how-to-measure-for-a-toilet-seat.html#:~:text=Typical%20width%3A%2014%22%20%2D%2014,length%3A%2018%22%20%2D%2019%22
">link to that website if you feel like visiting it<./a>

Now that I knew the dimensions of the seat I began designing. I wanted to create the least comfortable experience possible. Here is the design.

I had to extrude the design even though I was cutting in 2d with the Shaper, since the Shaper plugin for fusion really wanted me to. Now that I had finished the design I exported the file as an svg to a usb. 
Then began the trials and tribulations of using the Shaper to cut Obs. The shaper uses tape to locate itself and reference where to cut. But, that tape does not stick to obs. I tried fiddling with it and guessed that using carpenter's tape would solve my problems. It did, for a short time. The spindle kept picking up the tape. I forced my way through and managed to finalize the cut.

Here is a photo of the final result.

Also if you are intrested in using the shaper I wrote a short <a href="https://geordorini.github.io/Phys-12/shpaertutorial/index.html">tutorial on the Shaper.</a> From this project I also learned how to cut the obs in a much more effiecent way using the Shaper. If you are interested in that view the aforementioned tutorial. 
Notably the actual fusion design and the final outcome off the Shaper are only 3 or 4 millimeters different. 


### Molding and casting
For the second part of this assignment we were to make a mold and cast using that mold. I wanted to make a smiley face. To mold and cast I needed to make three things; the item to make the mold, the mold, and the cast from the mold. So, I began by making the item to form the mold. I did this by 3D printing. The smiley face is a very simple design. This design is actually only 2.5d which means I could have used wax and the SRM - 20 to make the Mold. But, I digress. The eyes and base are simple cylinders. The whole smile was only about 5 millimeters in diameter and was very small. This was to test the accuracy of both 3d printing and molding and casting.

Here is the prusa of the design. 

Here is what is looks like printed

Then I used a resin to form the mold from the 3d print. The resin I used looked like something from the barbie movie. It had a part A and B that needed a one to one ratio to form properly.

Here is the final Mold.

Using the mold I now am able to cast my smiley face.

This last cast used a one to one powder and water ratio. 

This is the final product.

It did not end up looking so good, but I think it was due to my mixing of the final cast. I was unsure of the exact consistency of the mix.
