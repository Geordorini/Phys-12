#### Week 3: kinetic sculpture

This week the focus was on making a sculpture of some sort that moves using a motor. I chose to make an ode to my car. I intended to make a side profile of a Dodge Challenger with a back wheel spinning and smoke rising behind it. In order to make the profile of the car I imposed an image into Fusion 360 using the canvas tool.

Then I went about outlining the shape of the challenger.

Below is the final result.

![sideprofile](./tada.png)

As visible above, the shape of this profile is very curved and this took me a very long time. In the process of sketching this profile, I had to use the spline tool a lot in order to match the curves of the challenger's body. The next step was cutting the profile out. I had been cutting all of my cads incorrectly for a long time, hence this step took a lot longer than expected. I lucked out eventually. However it wasn't until the next week that I learned the right way of printing. This was by far the largest hindrance in my project.

As well as the body I also wanted to create an artificial smoke effect using cams. I would stick a dowel on top of the cam and put a piece of paper on it to make it look like smoke.  
  


![cams](./cams.jpg)

It was a very simple design that turned out to be very flawed. The first issue I had was material. I was using cardboard and the edge of cardboard is not exactly smooth. This causes issues when trying to move vertically. Also, the vertical line causes rough movements. IF I had used a slanted line, it would have likely functioned smoother. The square hole in the center was fixed out to fit the axel. The axel I was using was a rectangular wooden dowel that was about 3 millimeters by meters on its face.

The assembly was a very difficult process for me since, as mentioned earlier, I did not cut anything correctly until very recently and I ran out of time in the lab. I was forced to improvise.

This might be the ugliest project you have ever seen, but it certainly is a project. The wheel does spin as does the axel and so do the cams.

There is a video of the car at the bottom of the page. 




### The Circutry 

I then needed to make  a cool arduino thing, I wanted to make a switch that you have to turn on before you can use a potentiometer  to spin the wheel. Also the switch would illumenate a head light on the front of the car. Firstly, I needed to attach the motor to the Arduino. I used the L9110 to more eaisly controll the motor. 

![onlinecircut](./coorect.png)

 Here is the code for this cicrutry setup. I used this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFFwFCuSZN4 a lot while making the code. I also used the inclass work code a lot as well. The goal of the code that is written is to make the wheel spin only if the led and the switch are on. I think it worked. However,


/*  Code to run motor in one direction based on potentiometer reading.
 *  Motor driver speed control on pin 3 (direction LOW by default)
 *  Potentiometer plugged into A0, A2, and A4 on Arduino Uno .
 */
int ledPin =  9; <br>
int switchPin= 7; <br>

void setup() { <br>
  pinMode(3, OUTPUT); <br>
  pinMode(A0, OUTPUT);  //This will be GND for the potentiometer  <br>
  pinMode(A4, OUTPUT);  //This will be 3.3V for the pot  <br>
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);  <br>
  pinMode(switchPin, INPUT); <br>

  digitalWrite(A0, LOW);  <br>
  digitalWrite(A4, HIGH);  <br>
  Serial.begin(9600); <br>
}

void loop() {
  //If the button is not pressed the motor cannot run <br>
  if (digitalRead(switchPin))( <br>
    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH)
  ); <br>
  int pot_value = analogRead(A2);   //pot wiper is on A2 <br>
  int motor_speed = map(pot_value, 0, 1023, 255, 0); // map motor_level to pot_value so that zero corresponds to lowest speed <br>
  analogWrite(3, motor_speed); <br>
  delay(100)
  ;
}
