#### Shaper Tutorial

  1. Instal the Shaper plugin for Fusion 360. Here is the <a href="https://apps.autodesk.com/FUSION/en/Detail/Index?id=3662665235866169729&os=Win64&appLang=en">link </a>. 
  Once installed, run the installer to actually install the plugin. Follow the downloaders instructions. Windows defender will warn you not to run the program.

  If you click more info, you can still run it.

  2. Design <br>
  Design a 2d object in fusion. Then extrude the object a small amount. Then click utilities and you will see the fusion plugin on the left side of the ribbon. If you don't see it, try restarting fusion. If you do see it, follow the plugin's instructions and export the file as an svg to a usb using the plugin.

  3. Set up <br>
The shaper uses tape to locate it self and cut. Setting up an area with tape is necessary to use the machine. The tape does not stick to obs, but if you are doing a small print you can get away with no tape over where you are cutting. The machine uses two cameras. One over the spindle and one looking in front of the machine. It uses the one looking over the machine to position itself. Make sure to measure the depth of the material you are cutting. In the lab there is a sacrifice board right now. If there is no sacrifice board it is probably a really good idea to put one down so you don't destroy the surface you are cutting on. Make sure to bolt down the material you are cutting.

3. Scan
Plug the Shaper in. Before cutting you must make a new scan of the work area. It scans using the camera in front of the machine. Sometimes you might need to scan a little bit off the table in order to see the wood while cutting. Its a whole bunch of weep woop.

4. Device <br>
  Plug in the usb to the usb port. Then click import. Find your file then place it using the intuitive placing system. There are scaling options too. Place the design on the object on the surface you are cutting on. Then click cut. Now, remember the depth of the material, enter that into the depth settings in the top left corner of the cutting page.

5. Vacum<br>
  Before cutting make sure to put the shop vac on the vacum hole and turn it on. Then turn on the spindle and hit the green button to start cutting by moving the shaper along the path shown on the screen.

Tips and Tricks
Always point the front facing camera towards the tape that is how the machine orients itself.
