#### Outputs Week 5 

For this week the major thing I made was a slap sensor that would detect if someone would slap the wall then play the Mcdonalds theme. The first thing I needed to do was to find the porper input device for detecting a slap. Using the knoweldge I gained from the last assginemnt I used a calibrated piezo sensor to measure the slap on a surface. To see how I calibrated and used the piezo sensor vist

Next I needed to figure out how to use the buzzer. The buzzer I used is the piezo buzzer. This is funny to me because my input uses the piezoceramic materials and my output uses piezoceramic mateiarls. The buzzer is using changes in volage to vibrate a thin sheet that then ressonates different notes by vibrating. My immedate thought was "make the mcdonalds theme song".

Here is an image of the piezo buzzer

First I needed to transcribe this spectacular melody. I found some image of sheet music online.

Now I need to transfer these musical notes into Hertz so that the buzzer can play a specific note. The notes of the Mcdonalds jingle or theme song are C D E A B. Now I need to translate that into Hertz. There are many prewritten progams and functions for transcribing music into hertz for the piezo buzzer specifcally but I wanted to do this one on my own. I used this list to translate into Hertz.

![notes-hertz](./musicnotes.png) 

Now all I have to do is code the buzzer to play those notes. The tone function in arduino is what I use to do this. Tone(outputpin, hertz, duration). That is the perimators of the buzzer. The issue now is timming. It took a lot of fiddiling to get this correct with delay.
<pre><code>
int buzzerPin = 10;



void setup() {
    pinMode(buzzerPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {

    tone(buzzerPin, 261.63, 200);
   delay(200);
    tone(buzzerPin, 293.66, 400);
    delay(400);
    tone(buzzerPin, 329.63, 400);
    delay(400);
    tone(buzzerPin, 440.00, 400);
    delay(400);
    tone(buzzerPin, 392.00, 400);
    delay(400);
   
    delay(2000);
}

</code></pre>


The real challenge is if I can make this use millis before tommorow. I now understand millis but I doubt I can use it like this. One solution I cam up with for a standalone program for the mcdonalds theme without the delay is this.





<pre><code>
int buzzerPin = 10;

unsigned long previousTime = 0;

void setup() {
    pinMode(buzzerPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {

unsigned long currentTime = millis()
  
    tone(buzzerPin, 261.63, 200);
  if (currentTime >= 400){
    tone(buzzerPin, 293.66, 400);
  }
  if (currentTime >= 1200){
    tone(buzzerPin, 329.63, 400);
  }
  If (currentTime  >= 2000){
    tone(buzzerPin, 440.00, 400);
  } 
  If (currentTime >= 2800){
    tone(buzzerPin, 392.00, 400);
  }
}

I effectively timed all the actions out and set it on a timeling. This one obviously did not work because alll of the sounds would keep playing. I need to put this into a loop because this code will become a funtion and I can not relly on millis. 

<pre><code>
  int buzzerPin = 10;

unsigned long previousTime = 0;

void setup() {
    pinMode(buzzerPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {

unsigned long currentTime = millis() - previousTime; //reset the clock 
    if (currentTime >= 0){
      tone(buzzerPin, 261.63, 200);
        if (currentTime >= 400){
    tone(buzzerPin, 293.66, 400);
            if (currentTime >= 1200){
    tone(buzzerPin, 329.63, 400);
             if (currentTime  >= 2000){
    tone(buzzerPin, 440.00, 400);
                if (currentTime >= 2800){
    tone(buzzerPin, 392.00, 400);
              }

            } 
         }

      }
    }
    
      
        
          
previousTime = currentTime;
}

I am very confused as to why this does not work. I thought you could nest if statements within each other. 

Anyway I had finished the buzzer and the piezo sensor code so it was time to combine them. 

<pre><code>
  int buzzerPin = 10;
int butt = 5;

int analog_pin = A3;
int tx_pin = 4;
int read_high;
int read_low;
int diff;
int big;  


void setup() {
    pinMode(buzzerPin, OUTPUT);
    pinMode(tx_pin, OUTPUT);      // Pin 4 provides the voltage step
    Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {

     digitalWrite(tx_pin,HIGH);           // Step the voltage high on conductor 1.
    read_high = analogRead(analog_pin);  // Measure response of conductor 2.
    delayMicroseconds(100);              // Delay to reach steady state.
    digitalWrite(tx_pin,LOW);            // Step the voltage to zero on conductor 1.
    read_low = analogRead(analog_pin);   // Measure response of conductor 2.
    diff = read_high - read_low;         // desired answer is the difference between high and low.
  if(diff>1020){
    Serial.println("KNOCK!");
    Mcfunction();
  }
}

void Mcfunction(){
 
 
 
  tone(buzzerPin, 261.63, 200);
   delay(200);
    tone(buzzerPin, 293.66, 400);
    delay(400);
    tone(buzzerPin, 329.63, 400);
    delay(400);
    tone(buzzerPin, 440.00, 400);
    delay(400);
    tone(buzzerPin, 392.00, 400);
    delay(400);
   
    delay(2000);

Here is a video of the working product. If that still refueses to work here is a

I measured the outpuut in a n oscilloscope. 

![osco](./Oscor.jpg)

![video](./thegif.gif)

The horizontal axis is time. 

The Vertical axis is voltage.

The frequecncy is the distance between each wave in hertz. 

This output has a steady voltage of baout 2.5 volts. 

The microcontroller very quickly gives and stops giving power in order to deilvier certain voltages. 

The length of each horizontal line varies on the note because each one has a different hertz.

The voltage outputs last between 5 and 10 milli secound. The lower notes have longer horzitonal lines. The higher pitches ones have shorter lines.
