#### Week 2: Laser Cuttering and 3d Cad 






Laser cutting is a very fast form of digital fabrication that is capable of printing different materials in seconds. The laser cutter only prints in 2d but using press fit designs it is possible to make 3d objects. In order to make a press fit design work the thickness of the material has to match the width of the notch. The notch is the hole designed to fit around the material to connect different pieces.

Speaking of Design, above is my first itteration of the press fit peice. I wanted to make an absrtact structure using one peice. The first design was a diamond that measured 50 by 35 milimeters. In order to make this design I first created a new file in Fusion 360. Then I created a new sketch. I chose to do my sketch from the top. I then used the reactangle tool to make a rectangle of those demensions. Then I used the line tool to connect the adjacent midpoints in the rectangle. Then, I delted the orignal lines of the rectangle and was left with the product above.

In the first ideration of the design I made, I presumed the Kerf of the laser cutter was .8 milimeters. The kerf is the material that the laser cutter takes off from the material that goes unaccounted for in a design. This was the primary challenge of the press fit design. In order to account for the kerf, I had to subtract the thickness of the material by the estimated kerf. I disguinshed the kerf by finding the difference in the cad model and the physical model in size of notch. The Kerf turned out to be 1 milimeter. 

![Final Parameters](./Paremeters2)

One of the final steps of the process is using the fillet tool to curve the edges of the design. In order to use that tool effectively, I had to extrude the design into 3d then use the fillet tool on all the notchs corners.

This is what the final design ended up looking like. I nneded to shrink the size of the design in order to limit the amount of waste I produced. It did not really mater if I made a massive peice or a small one so I figured I would use a smaller one.
