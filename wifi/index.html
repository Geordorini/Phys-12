#### Using Wifi with an Esp 32

For this assignment we needed to get an esp to communicate over the web. I was able to get a live feed from the Esp 32 cam over wifi. I struggled for a long time with getting any esp to function with my computer. I had feeling it was Windows 11. After returning home to my computer that runs windows 10, the esp communicated with no issue. 
This is the Esp 32 cam.

There are two pieces the top which is actualy the esp cam with the camera.

Then there is the bottum which saves me from working with the pinouts of the cam and also saves me from using FTDI programmer.

In order to upload code and use the cam I needed to install the esp 32 drivers. That and all of the code for this assignment can be found 
<a href="https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-cam-video-streaming-face-recognition-arduino-ide/"> here </a>

After installing the drivers I then pulled up the example code for the Esp Cam. 

<a href="https://https://geordorini.github.io/Phys-12/hiddencode/index.html"> Link to only code </a>

The code from the examples list for Esp 32s. I had to put the name of my wifi adress and the password. I refuse to publish either of those things online.

I then uploaded the code to the arduino. It then gave the IP adress of the chip. I was then able to see a live feed of the camera. This feed was being shown to everyone in the network if they wanted to access it. 
This is what the website looks like.

This the camera pointing at the website which is showing what the camera is showing.

This is some video of the camera functioning screenrecorded from my laptop.
